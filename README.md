## Initial setup

```
# From the root of the project execute the following command:
bin/setup
```

**NOTE:** Ensure the `.env.development` settings are correctly configured.

### Run the application server

```
bin/rails s
```

NOTE: You also need to start sidekiq in another terminal window:

```
bundle exec sidekiq
```

### Running tests

```
VCR_RECORD_MODE=all bin/rake
```

[There is an (deprecated) alternative setup procedure (not recommended), using the makefile, which can be found here](./docs/README_alt.md)

## Deployment

The deployment is triggered on all builds in [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/ministryofjustice/laa-apply-for-legal-aid) but requires approval to the desired environment.

**NOTE:** **git-crypt** is required to store secrets required for **uat**, **staging** and **production** environments. To be able to modify those secrets, **git-crypt** needs to be set up according to the following [guide](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/cloud-platform-user-docs/03-other-topics/001-git-crypt-setup/#git-crypt).

* For more information on howto setup **Helm** in your local environment refer to the following [guide](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/cloud-platform-user-docs/02-deploying-an-app/002-app-deploy-helm/#installing-and-configuring-helm-and-tiller).
* For more deployment information refer to the specific [README](./helm_deploy/apply-for-legal-aid/README.md)

### UAT Deployments

**NOTE: Until an automated process is put in place to deal with this issue, once a branch has been merged into master or deleted, for which there's an associated release, the following commands should be executed to ensure those releases are deleted, as they're no longer necessary:**

```
# list the availables releases:
helm list --tiller-namespace=laa-apply-for-legalaid-uat --namespace=laa-apply-for-legalaid-uat --debug --all

# delete a specific release
helm delete <name-of-the-release> --tiller-namespace=laa-apply-for-legalaid-uat --purge
```


## LAA Portal Authentication dev setup

Add the following to .env.development
```
LAA_PORTAL_IDP_SSO_TARGET_URL=https://portal.tst.legalservices.gov.uk/oamfed/idp/samlv20
LAA_PORTAL_IDP_CERT=< LAA_PORTAL_IDP_CERT (dev)>
LAA_PORTAL_CERTIFICATE=< LAA_PORTAL_CERTIFICATE (dev)>
LAA_PORTAL_SECRET_KEY=< LAA_PORTAL_SECRET_KEY(dev)>
LAA_PORTAL_MOCK_SAML=false
```
** Note the above keys can be found in rattic

Mock Saml request on dev add the the following settings

```
LAA_PORTAL_IDP_SSO_TARGET_URL=http://localhost:3002/saml/auth
LAA_PORTAL_MOCK_SAML=true
```

## Databases

### Staging and Production

Staging and production databases are RDS instances on the MOJ Cloud Platform. Connection details are held in Rattic.

These databases are within the AWS VPC and are not publicly available. In order to connect
to an RDS database from a local client, first run:

`kubectl -n laa-apply-for-legalaid-staging port-forward port-forward-rds 5433:80`

This will then allow you to connect to the database, eg:

`psql --host=localhost --port=5433 --username=<username> --password --dbname=apply_for_legal_aid_staging`

- Change `staging` to `production` in the above commands to access production.
- Port 5433 is used in the above examples instead of the usual 5432 for postgres, as 5432 will not work if postgres is running locally.

## 3rd party integrations

### True Layer

To connect the True Layer API, a client ID and client SECRET must be supplied. They can be
set via the environment variables `TRUE_LAYER_CLIENT_ID` and `TRUE_LAYER_CLIENT_SECRET`
respectively. Visit https://console.truelayer.com to get a client ID and client SECRET.

True Layer offer a Mock Bank option (see https://docs.truelayer.com/#mock-users). To enable
this functionality, set the environment variable `TRUE_LAYER_ENABLE_MOCK` to `"true"`.
