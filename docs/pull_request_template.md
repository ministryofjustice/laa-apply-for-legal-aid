Describe what you did and why.

## Checklist

Before you ask people to review this PR:

- Tests and rubocop should be passing: `bundle exec rake`
- Github should not be reporting conflicts; you should have recently run `git rebase master`.
- There should be no unnecessary whitespace changes. These make diffs harder to read and conflicts more likely.
- The PR description should say what you changed and why, with a link to the JIRA story.
- You should have looked at the diff against master and ensured that nothing unexpected is included in your changes.
- You should have checked that the commit messages say why the change was made.
