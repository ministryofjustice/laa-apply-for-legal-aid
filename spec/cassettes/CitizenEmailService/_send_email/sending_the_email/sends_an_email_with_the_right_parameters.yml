        solicitor at Vandervort, Crona and Bechtelar has started your legal aid application
        with the Legal Aid Agency (LAA).\r\n\r\nYour case reference is L-LF7-0KL.\r\n\r\n#
        What is the LAA?\r\n \r\nWe are a government body providing civil and criminal
        legal aid and advice to help people deal with their legal problems.\r\n \r\n#
        What happens next\r\n\r\nWe need to check if you qualify financially for legal
        aid.\r\n\r\n# How we do this\r\n\r\nWe check 3 months of your bank statements
        to see the kinds of payments you make and receive. This helps us work out
        if you can get legal aid or you need to pay towards the costs.\r\n\r\nWith
        your permission, we securely collect your bank statements online using a third-party
        service called TrueLayer. This means you do not need to gather physical bank
        statements and send them to your solicitor.\r\n\r\n# What you need to do\r\n
        \r\nAccess the ''Apply for legal aid'' service using the link below. You can
        do this on any device.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll then be redirected to your bank\u2019s
        website or app where you can:\r\n\r\n* sign in to your online banking\r\n*
        give TrueLayer permission to collect 3 months of bank statements on behalf
        of the LAA\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll also need to answer questions about the types
        of payments you make and receive.\r\n\r\nIf you do not agree to this, or you
        need more information, contact your solicitor.\r\n\r\n# What is TrueLayer?\r\n\r\nTrueLayer
        is a trusted third-party financial service provider that acts as a messenger
        between your client''s bank and the LAA.\r\n\r\nTrueLayer is regulated by
        the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and will not:\r\n\r\n* store your bank
        account details\r\n* see your online banking sign-in details\r\n* share your
        details with anyone other than the LAA\r\n* have any ongoing access to your
        bank account details\r\n\r\n# Access the service\r\n\r\nhttp://www.example.com/citizens/legal_aid_applications/3fb45c13-b3ec-4a87-abb2-1362c5483d28?locale=en\r\n\r\nThis
