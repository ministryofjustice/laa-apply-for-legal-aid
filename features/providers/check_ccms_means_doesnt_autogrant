Feature: Checking ccms means does NOT auto grant 

 @javascript
 Scenario: I am able to create a passported application with Cap Contribs > Â£3k and with restrictions
   Given I have set the Manually review all non-passported applications in the Admin tool to Yes/ON
   Given I previously created a passported application and left on the "savings_and_investment" page
   Then I visit the applications page
   Then I view the previously created application
   Then I am on the Which types of savings or investments does your client have? page
   And I click on "Money not in bank account" checkbox
   Then I fill "Enter the total amount" with "4000"
   Then I click 'Save and continue'
   Then I should be on a page showing "Which types of assets does your client have?"
   Then I click on "None of these" checkbox
   Then I click 'Save and continue'
   Then I should be on a page showing "Are there any legal restrictions that prevent your client from selling or borrowing against their assets?"
   Then I click on the "Yes" radio button
   Then I fill "Tell us which assets they cannot sell or borrow against, and why" with "Mikes cucumber"
   Then I click 'Save and continue'
   Then I should be on a page showing "Select if your client has received payments from these schemes or charities"
   Then I click on "None of these" checkbox
   Then I click 'Save and continue'
   Then I should be on a page showing "Check your answers"
   Then I click 'Save and continue'
   Then I should be on a page showing "We need to check if ???"
   Then I click 'Save and continue'
