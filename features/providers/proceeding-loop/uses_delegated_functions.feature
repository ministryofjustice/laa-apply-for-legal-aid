Feature: Extended proceeding loop

  @javascript @vcr
  Scenario: When the application has a single proceeding and I'm going to use delegated functions
    Given the feature flag for enable_mini_loop is enabled
    And the feature flag for enable_loop is enabled
    And I have started an application and reached the proceedings list
    When I choose 'No'
    And I click 'Save and continue'
    Then I should see 'Proceeding 1\nInherent jurisdiction high court injunction\nWhat is your clientâ€™s role in this proceeding?'
    When I choose 'Applicant/claimant/petitioner'
    And I click 'Save and continue'
    Then I should see 'Proceeding 1\nInherent jurisdiction high court injunction\nHave you used delegated functions for this proceeding?'
    When I choose 'Yes'
    And I enter the 'delegated functions on' date of 5 days ago
    When I click 'Save and continue'
    Then I should see 'Proceeding 1\nInherent jurisdiction high court injunction\nFor the emergency application, do you want to use the default level of service and scope?'
    When I choose 'Yes'
    And I click 'Save and continue'
    Then I should see 'Proceeding 1\nInherent jurisdiction high court injunction\nDo you want to use the default level of service and scope for the substantive application?'
    When I choose 'Yes'
    And I click 'Save and continue'
    Then I should be on the 'limitations' page showing 'Inherent jurisdiction high court injunction'
