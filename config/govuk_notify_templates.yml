# We use 2 different GOV.UK Notify services, one for development/integration
# purposes and another one for production. This is so we can test changes
# to the templates in a controlled environment, before these changes make their
# way to production (and real users can see them).
#
# As these are 2 separate services in GOV.UK Notify, the template IDs are also
# different, so we declare them in this file. We use the value of the variable
# ENV['GOVUK_NOTIFY_ENV'] if defined to know which group to load, otherwise
# we default to 'integration' group.
